## Endpoints
By default, AWS Security Token Service (STS) is available as a global service, and all AWS STS requests go to a single endpoint at https://sts.amazonaws.com. Global requests map to the US East (N. Virginia) Region. AWS recommends using Regional AWS STS endpoints instead of the global endpoint to reduce latency, build in redundancy, and increase session token validity.
